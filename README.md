# Risk-assessment-and-optimisation-of-defences-for-sequential-multiphase-cyber-attacks
Abstract:

Assessing and controlling cyber risk is the cornerstone of information security management. However, the uncertainties associated with cyber attacks, the resulting risk exposure, and the availability of scarce resources for investment in mitigation measures make it challenging for organisations to assess and control cyber risk. In this paper, we develop a decision support framework for optimal cyber security investment that accounts for the serial nature of a cyber attack, the uncertainty in the time required to exploit a vulnerability, and the optimisation of mitigation measures in the presence of a limited budget. First, we evaluate the cost that an organisation incurs as a result of a cyber security breach that progresses in phases, and derive an analytical expression for the  distribution of the present value of the cost. Second, we adopt a Set Covering and a Knapsack formulation to derive and compare optimal strategies for investment in mitigation measures. Third, we validate our work via a case study based on: (i) the 2020 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) top 25 most dangerous software weaknesses; and (ii) the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. Specifically, we demonstrate how the Knapsack optimisation methodology provides solutions that are both more affordable and entail lower risk compared to those of the Set Covering formulation. Also, we find that investing more in security does not necessarily lead to a better reduction of risk. This counter-intuitive result emphasises how the rate of risk reduction decreases beyond a certain point of security investment.
