# Cyber Risk Assessment and Optimisation: A Small Business Case Study
Abstract:

Assessing and controlling cyber risk is the cornerstone of information security management,
but also a formidable challenge for organisations due to the uncertainties associated with attacks, the
resulting risk exposure, and the availability of scarce resources for investment in mitigation measures. In
this paper, we propose a cybersecurity decision-support framework, called CENSOR, for optimal cyber
security investment. CENSOR accounts for the serial nature of a cyber attack, the uncertainty in the time
required to exploit a vulnerability, and the optimisation of mitigation measures in the presence of a limited
budget. First, we evaluate the cost that an organisation incurs due to a cyber security breach that progresses
in stages and derive an analytical expression for the distribution of the present value of the cost. Second, we
adopt a Set Covering and a Knapsack formulation to derive and compare optimal strategies for investment
in mitigation measures. Third, we validate CENSOR via a case study of a small business (SB) based on:
(i) the 2020 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) top 25 most dangerous software weaknesses; and (ii)
the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. Specifically, we demonstrate how the Knapsack formulation
provides solutions that are both more affordable and entail lower risk compared to those of the Set Covering
formulation. Interestingly, our results confirm that investing more in cybersecurity does not necessarily lead
to an analogous cyber risk reduction, which indicates that the latter decelerates beyond a certain point of
security investment intensity.
